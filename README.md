### How to play
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water as many times as possible, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down using the keyboard arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player reaches the water, the player is reset back to the start square and the game gets faster. The game ends when you colide with an enemy and you receive your final score.
